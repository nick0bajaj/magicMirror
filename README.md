Magic Mirror created by Nikhil Bajaj
Prototype for an idea of a smart mirror. Created using a design concept called "wizard of oz" where prototype's features are triggered through a remote in order to speed up development and get critiques before creating a final product. Remote can be used on a smart phone through the 'wizard' link, 'wand' for access sensor remote located in "Portal - Wand" and the screen to create a virtual mirror is in "Magic Mirror UI" (requires a webcam).
